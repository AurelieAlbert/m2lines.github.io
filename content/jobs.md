M<sup>2</sup>LInES: Multiscale Machine Learning In coupled Earth System Modeling 
Multiple positions are available as part of a new international project, M<sup>2</sup>LInES, funded by Schmidt Futures. The overall goal of the project is to improve climate projections and reduce climate model biases, especially at the air-sea interface, using machine learning. We will rely on data from a range of high-resolution (idealized and global) simulations and data assimilation products to deepen our understanding and improve the representation of subgrid physics in the ocean, sea-ice and atmosphere components of existing IPCC-class climate models. This is a highly collaborative project, and the researchers are expected to interact with different groups. For more information on the project, please see: https://m2lines.github.io 

Open positions: 

**NYU** 

Project manager (Â½ time) will be hired to coordinate with different groups within M<sup>2</sup>LInES, interface with the funders, and support the lead institution on day-to-day activities related to the project. 

3 Postdocs in Machine Learning for climate modelling will be hired to  develop 1) advanced scale- and physics-aware deep learning algorithms;  2) probabilistic deep learning algorithms; 3) interpretable machine learning-based toolkits for physics-discovery.  

1 postdoc in Ocean Mesoscale Processes and Air-sea Coupling will be hired to focus on deepening our understanding of air-sea coupling and mesoscale eddy momentum and energy in the ocean, and their parameterizations via machine learning.  

**Columbia University**

Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory: One postdoc will be hired to develop data-driven parameterizations for ocean sub-gridscale tracer transport and air-sea interaction, focusing on upper-ocean mesoscale processes. 

Dept. Of Earth and Environmental Engineering: One postdoc will be hired to work on the atmospheric boundary layer, with a focus on stable boundary layers and the surface interaction with sea ice and its heterogeneity.  

**Princeton University**

One postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to develop a parameterization of model bias correction in the context of an ocean data assimilation system.  

One postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to improve the representation of vertical mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer for climate model applications.  

One postdoc to apply machine learning techniques to a sea ice data assimilation system with the goal of improving structural errors in a coupled sea ice model.  

One postdoc to implement existing machine-learned parameterizations in the MOM6 ocean model and to further develop/implement machine-learned parameterizations of missing processes and model bias in both MOM6 and the sea-ice model SIS2. 

**NCAR** 

One postdoc will be hired to work on sea ice and ice-atmosphere interactions. This will include work on characterizing the heterogeneity in sea ice characteristics, including snow and ice thickness, and developing parameterizations of the thermodynamic influence of this heterogeneity.  

One postdoc will be hired to analyze atmospheric analysis increments to learn flow-dependent random and systematic errors with emphasis on near-surface processes over the ocean.  

**Future openings:** 

There will be positions  opening later at MIT (on atmospheric deep convection), CNRS-IPSL (on validation and testing of ocean parameterizations in IPSL climate model) and CNRS-IGE (on submesoscale parameterizations).
